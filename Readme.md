#### Assignment Goal
Create a command-line application that, given a list of website URLs as input, visits them and finds, extracts and outputs the websitesâ€™ logo image URLs and all phone numbers (e.g. mobile phones, land lines, fax numbers) present on the websites.

## Running The Application
- Download the repository zip file and extract the folder named "dbassign-master" to your desktop.
- Open the Command Prompt\PowerShell\Bash and navigate to the "dbassign-master" folder.
- Build the docker image using the following command `docker build -t dnb .`

#### Using Windows Command Prompt
- Run the docker image using the following command `docker run -i dnb < [PATH_TO_TXT_FILE]`

#### Using Powershell or Bash
- Run the docker image using the following command `cat [PATH_TO_TXT_FILE] | docker run -i dnb`

## Application Overview
#### Application arguments
The application support two arguments:

-  `-v, --verbose` - Print logs to std.err during application run. **For example**
`docker run -i [IMAGE_NAME] -v < [PATH_TO_TXT_FILE]`

-  `-t, --threads` - Specifying how many threads to use. Default is 16. **For example**
`docker run -i [IMAGE_NAME] -t [NUM_OF_THREADS] < [PATH_TO_TXT_FILE]`

#### Website's logo extraction method
After research during the assignment, I found two main methods to extract the website's logo. 
1. Search the `<link>` tag that stores the favicon inside the `<head>` tag and extracts the website's logo.
2. Search the first `<img>` or `<svg>` tags that appear inside the `<body>` tag while assuming that, in absolute most cases, the first image is the website's logo.

After quite long consideration, I decided to use method number two while comparing my results to the example result you attached to the assignment description.
